## After Deployment

### 1. Test Your Deployed API

Once deployed, test your API:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app-url.com/health

# Test invoice analysis
curl -X POST "https://your-app-url.com/analyze-invoice" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "text": "INVOICE #INV-001\nABC Company\nTotal: $150.00\nDate: 2024-01-15"
     }'
```

### 2. Update Google Apps Script

In your Google Apps Script `Code.gs`, update the backend URL:

```javascript
// Replace with your actual deployed URL
const BACKEND_URL = 'https://your-app-url.com';
```

### 3. Test the Complete Flow

1. Open Google Sheets
2. Go to Extensions â†’ Apps Script
3. Run the `onOpen` function
4. Refresh Google Sheets
5. Click "Invoice Extractor AI" â†’ "Open Invoice Analyzer"
6. Test with sample invoice text

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors:**
   - The backend already includes CORS middleware
   - If issues persist, check your deployment platform's CORS settings

2. **API Key Issues:**
   - Verify the API key is set correctly in your deployment platform
   - Check if you have sufficient OpenAI credits

3. **Port Issues:**
   - Most platforms use `$PORT` environment variable
   - The code is already configured for this

4. **Import Errors:**
   - All dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
   - The deployment platforms will install them automatically

## Performance Optimization (Optional)

For production use, consider:

1. **Add Rate Limiting:**
   ```python
   # Add to requirements.txt
   slowapi==0.1.9
   ```

2. **Add Caching:**
   ```python
   # Add to requirements.txt
   redis==5.0.1
   ```

3. **Add Monitoring:**
   ```python
   # Add to requirements.txt
   sentry-sdk[fastapi]==1.40.0
   ```

## Security Checklist

- âœ… API key is in environment variables
- âœ… CORS is properly configured
- âœ… Input validation is implemented
- âœ… Error handling is comprehensive
- âœ… HTTPS is enforced (on deployment platforms)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy using one of the options above**
2. **Update your Google Apps Script with the new URL**
3. **Test the complete workflow**
4. **Share with users!**
